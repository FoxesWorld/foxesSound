/**
 * The <code>AudioDevice</code> interface provides an abstraction for
 * a device capable of sounding audio samples. Samples are written to 
 * the device wia the write() method. The device assumes
 * that these samples are signed 16-bit samples taken at the output frequency
 * of the decoder. If the decoder outputs more than one channel, the samples for
 * each channel are assumed to appear consecutively, with the lower numbered
 * channels preceeding higher-numbered channels. E.g. if there are two
 * channels, the samples will appear in this order:
 * <pre><code>
 * 
 *		l0, r0, l1, r1, l2, r2...
 * 
 * where 
 *	l<i>x</i> indicates the <i>x</i>th sample on channel 0
 *  r<i>x</i> indicates the <i>x</i>th sample on channel 1
